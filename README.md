# GAN
> There are the variety of  Keras implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These examples are simplified versions whose applied on the MNIST which is a handwritten digital dataset. But these ".py" files can be also exploited asthe efficient model-building API. Every one who is interested about GANs can refer and use these implementations to build various kinds of GAN effiently and easily.

## Implementations
### Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)
> DCGAN could be implemented using deep CNNs.


### Conditional GAN (CGAN)
>CGAN added the condition (indexing label) network to DCGAN, and CGAN can generate the specific label fake data as your appointment.

### Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)
